Here is where you can drop any jupyter notebook files.

* Just be sure to document what you are doing at it each step. 
* Keep it concise
* let me know if you want me to add it to the flask application. 

***IMPORTANT***
jupyter python code does not translate perfectly to flask applications. So please do not just copy code into flask app.
